pip3 install PySimpleGUI
pip3 install stomp.py

things to fix:

number_guesser:
If P1 is human and P2 is robot, at end say: 
"...it took me X guesses instead of it took you X guesses"

In player controls, hide the elements for playing number_guesser until game is active.

Take out debug statements

killall number_guesser.py if we have stale process
